A lot of people **dont know** where to find basic **addresses** so feel free to browse on this repo | Additional background information is also on the function!

# luau_load/luau_deserialize

`luau_load` calls 4 arguments, which recieve `luastate`, `chunk name` which if you error it will show the chunk, `.c_str` converts string style, `.size` which gets the size of the bytecode.

**Search oldResult =** which will be a lua script.

The address will **NOT** be the function that has **oldResult**, go up to the first code block for the address.

# spawn

`spawn` calls 1 argument, which recieve `luastate`, placed with the function that pushes bytecode.

**Search Spawn function requires** which will be a string.

The address will be at the first code block.
